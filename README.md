# POWER BI PROJECTS
    
This repository is created to document DAX solutions I used in my Power BI projects from my portfolio.  [See a full version of my projects and explore the visualizations here.](https://sirishultz.com/)


# Customer Personality Analysis

This project was inspired by the Data Science Project on Customer Personality Analysis with Python that was created by [Aman Kharwal](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/02/08/customer-personality-analysis-with-python/). I used a dataset that provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). My goal was to create a similar project, but use Power BI instead of Python. I used Power BI and Power Query to prepare/clean data, created fact and dimension tables for data modeling, and connected them with relationships. I also created measures and calculated columns for grouping and the calculation process. Finally, I create the visualizations below to show the results of the analysis.

# 25 Days of Dax Challenge

This challenge created by [Ruth Pozuelo Martinez (Microsoft MVP)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002323), a Power BI expert.  She posted DAX questions every day between December 1-25, 2021 and invited anyone to solve the challenge using there own way. I had so much fun joining this challenge and love to share my solutions and see different way from other people.
