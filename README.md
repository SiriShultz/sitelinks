# POWER BI PROJECTS
    
This repository is created to document DAX solutions I used in my Power BI projects from my portfolio.  [See a full version of my projects and explore the visualizations on my portfolio here.](https://sirishultz.com/)


# [Customer Personality Analysis](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/Customer-Personality-Analysis)

This project was inspired by the Data Science Project on Customer Personality Analysis with Python that was created by [Aman Kharwal](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/02/08/customer-personality-analysis-with-python/). I used a dataset that provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). My goal was to create a similar project, but use Power BI instead of Python. I used Power BI and Power Query to prepare/clean data, created fact and dimension tables for data modeling, and connected them with relationships. I also created measures and calculated columns for grouping and the calculation process. Finally, I create the visualizations below to show the results of the analysis, [see the full project here.](https://sirishultz.com/portfolio/customer-personality-analysis)

     


# [25 Days of Dax Challenge](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/25-Days-DAX-Challenge)

This challenge created by [Ruth Pozuelo Martinez (Microsoft MVP)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002323), a Power BI expert.  She posted DAX questions every day between December 1-25, 2021 and invited anyone to solve the challenge using there own way. I had so much fun joining this challenge and love to share my solutions, plus like to see how other people approach and solve the daily challenges.

# [Web Analytics Time Series](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/Web-Analytics) with Calculation Group and Custom Conditional Formatting

This project was created by using a mock dataset from Google Analytics. The data shows overall web traffic by device type in different time periods. Creating a Time Series Analysis can result in many measures with similar calculations. I used Tabular Editor (an external tool from Power BI) to create a [Calculation Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=asallproducts-allversions) that helps reduce the number of measures required to create the visualizations. However, applying conditional formatting to a Calculation Group can be challenging; so I also created some additional measures to customize the formatting for the specific calculation items.

# [Dynamic Ranking & Top N Slicer (What If Parameter)](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/Dynamic%20Ranking%20%26%20Top%20N%20Slicer)

This project was created by using an Open Source flatefile datasetÂ (CSV) exported from [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). The original file contains 271 columns and more than 30,000 rows. The data shows monthly Home Value Index populated by Zillow from January, 2000 to December, 2021 across the regions (zipcode, city, metro, state). I used Power Query to clean and extract data, created one fact table and two dimension tables (Calendar and Geographic), and imported/merged an extra file for a full state name which did not exist in the original file. After created data modeling between tables, I use DAX to perform calculations for needed metrics and dynamic rankings for each geographic level. I also created a dynamic title/head line that changes based on filters selection. I added the What If Parameters to the reports as slicers to let the user choose the Top N ranking.

# Work Out Wednesday

Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge to re-create data-driven visualizations. The challenges are designed to kick-start personal development in Tableau and Power BI. Each Wednesday, a challenge is released and participants are asked to replicate the challenge as closely as possible using their own Power BI Skills.  [Learn more about the challenge >>](https://www.workout-wednesday.com/) or [visit my portfolio to see my Power BI visuals.](https://sirishultz.com/portfolio/wow-challenges)
