# POWER BI PROJECTS
    
This repository is created to document DAX solutions I used in my Power BI projects from my portfolio.  [See a full version of my projects and explore the visualizations on my portfolio here.](https://sirishultz.com/)


# [Customer Personality Analysis](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/Customer-Personality-Analysis)

This project was inspired by the Data Science Project on Customer Personality Analysis with Python that was created by [Aman Kharwal](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/02/08/customer-personality-analysis-with-python/). I used a dataset that provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). My goal was to create a similar project, but use Power BI instead of Python. I used Power BI and Power Query to prepare/clean data, created fact and dimension tables for data modeling, and connected them with relationships. I also created measures and calculated columns for grouping and the calculation process. Finally, I create the visualizations below to show the results of the analysis, [see the full project here.](https://sirishultz.com/portfolio/customer-personality-analysis)

     


# [25 Days of Dax Challenge](https://github.com/SiriShultz/sitelinks/tree/main/25-Days-DAX-Challenge)

This challenge created by [Ruth Pozuelo Martinez (Microsoft MVP)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002323), a Power BI expert.  She posted DAX questions every day between December 1-25, 2021 and invited anyone to solve the challenge using there own way. I had so much fun joining this challenge and love to share my solutions, plus like to see how other people approach and solve the daily challenges.

# Web Analytics Time Series with Calculation Group and Custom Conditional Formatting

This project was created by using a mock dataset from Google Analytics. The data shows overall web traffic by device type in different time periods. Creating a Time Series Analysis can result in many measures with similar calculations. I used Tabular Editor (an external tool from Power BI) to create a [Calculation Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=asallproducts-allversions) that helps reduce the number of measures required to create the visualizations. However, applying conditional formatting to a Calculation Group can be challenging; so I also created some additional measures to customize the formatting for the specific calculation items.

# Work Out Wednesday

Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge to re-create data-driven visualizations. The challenges are designed to kick-start personal development in Tableau and Power BI. Each Wednesday, a challenge is released and participants are asked to replicate the challenge as closely as possible using their own Power BI Skills.
