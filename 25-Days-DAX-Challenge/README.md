# Day 2
This is how to create a gray box
Need to start with 4 spaces, the hit enter

Once done, then hit enter twice - the move the cursor to the left margin
    
Starting a new box


    Enter, then hit the spacebar 4 times to start the box
    Each time you hit enter, it will go to the next row - indented automatically
    Enter again, keep typing
    Enter again, another row. When done, click enter twice
    And then on that next word, hit the backspace so it aligns all the way to the left
    
End


# Day 3

Some bullet points - create by using a star

* one, hit enter
* two, keep on going
* three, if this is the last one then enter twice and move back to the left indent

Plus can add links under the bullets, just hit the * first and then use the link format with the brackets and parenthesis

* Link to Google.com right here -- [Google.com](https://www.google.com)
* Another link - this one to [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)
* Similar to the <a> and then </> after - to insert [anchor text LINK](https://www.fixclicks.net) within the sentence

End
    

# Day 4

Go back to [Day 2](https://github.com/billsteeley/shared-links/blob/main/README.md#day-2)
    
Trying to combine these things

    Trying to add links within a gray box
    Like putting a [link on this phrase](https://www.fixclicks.net) within this sentence
    Nope, that doesn't work
    How about some bullet points in the gray box? Let's try
    * one
    * two
    * three
    Nope - that doesn't seem to work either
    
Hit enter twice and then backspace to the left margin
