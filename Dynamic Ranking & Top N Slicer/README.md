# Dynamic Ranking & Top N Slicer (What If Parameter)

This project was created by using a flatefile datasetÂ (CSV) exported from [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). The original file contains 271 columns and more than 30,000 rows. The data shows monthly Home Value Index populated by Zillow from January, 2000 to December, 2021 across the regions (zipcode, city, metro, state). I use Power Query to clean and extract data then create 1 fact table and 2 dimension tables (Calendar and Geographic) and also imported/merged an extra file for a full state name which is not exist in the original file. After created data modeling between tables I use DAX to perform calculation of needed metrics and dynamic ranking in each geographic level. I also create a dynamic title/head line that will change based on filters selection. I added the What If Parameters to the reports as slicers to let the user choose the number of Top N of the metrics.

# Date Table

Start with January 1st of minmimum year and ends wtih December 31st of maximum year.

    Calendar = 
    VAR MyCal = CALENDAR(MIN('fHomeValue'[Date]), MAX('fHomeValue'[Date]))
    Return
    ADDCOLUMNS(MyCal,
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Quarter", FORMAT([Date],"\Qq"),
    "MonthNum", MONTH([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date],"mmmm"),
    "Month/Year", FORMAT([Date],"mmm yyyy"),
    "Year-Month sort", FORMAT([Date], "yyyy-mm")
    )


# Measures for Analysis


# Average Home Value
Create a measure to calculate the average home value.

    AvgHomeValue = AVERAGE(fHomeValue[HomeValue])

# Ranking for all level of regions.
Create measures to rank the average home value in all level of regions (city, metro, state)

    City Rank =
    RANKX(ALL(dGeo[City-State]),[AvgHomeValue])
    
    Metro Rank =
    RANKX(ALL(dGeo[Metro]),[AvgHomeValue])
    
    State Rank =
    RANKX(ALL(dGeo[StateName]),[AvgHomeValue])
